# Recommendations and notes

While not a direct dependency, the authors recommend using the [QuantumOptics.jl](https://qojulia.org/) to model the details of the quantum system (vectors/operators used in the computation). At the moment, GOAT.jl does not have methods that accept operator types from QuantumOptics.jl, but we do plan to add this functionality in the future.
