# Gradient Optimization of Analytic Controls in Julia -- GOAT.jl

This project is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) implementation of the Gradient Optimization of Analytic conTrols (GOAT) optimal control methodology proposed in [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.150401) by Machnes et al.

The implementation only currently supports optimizing unitary evolution. Please peruse through the documentation and examples.
